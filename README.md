# e-Tournaments

This project is a service for creating tournaments. \
Version 1.0 allows users to create tournaments tables for up to 100 players. There is only one set of rules. Players 
plays with each other. For each match player can get 0pt. (lose), 1pt.(draw), 3pt.(win). Rank is based on points 
gathered for all played matches. If same amount of point is gathered by more than one player, "small" points won during 
matches are taken into consideration. \
Tournament ends when all mathes are played, or when tournament moderator decides it. Not all matches need to be played.
